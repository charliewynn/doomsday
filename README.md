Doomsday quizzer alexa skill

The skill doesn't actually read off github, I'm still uploading my function manually to Lambda.

future endevors:  
I would like it if insteading of saying "subtract one week, add 6 days I would just say subtract one day"
possibly -1w+5d as well should just be -2d.. not sure if I'll implement it ever.
